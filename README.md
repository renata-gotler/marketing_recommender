This repository aims to serve as an ML Product Template. 
<br>After the model is approved, you should move the project to its own repository following this template. As this is a production product, all software engineering best practices are required, such as SOLID code principles, PEP8 python design code and a minimum of 85% unit test coverage.
Here, test coverage and running all tests with success must be PR blockers.
See Confluence documentation Machine Learning Process for more information regarding requirements in this environment. </br>
